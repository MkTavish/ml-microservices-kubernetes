## **Overview**
The pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on the data source site.

It was deployed on an Ubuntu 18.04 EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services

## **Tasks**
- Clone this repository
- CD into the cloned repositiry
- Install Python3 Virtualenv
- Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv ~/environmentname`
- Activate the environment `source ~/environmentname/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies via project Makefile with `make install`. project dependencies are listed in the file requirements.txt 
- Install Docker, Kubernetes(minikube) and Hadolint
- Run and build a docker image with `./run_docker.sh` (This will build and list docker the run the containerized Flask app. 
- Then call `./make_prediction.sh`. This shell script is responsible for sending some input data to your containerized application via the appropriate port.
- Edit `run_docker.sh` with your unique username and tagged image id then run `run_docker.sh` to upload your image to Docker Hub.
- Start Mikikube with `minikube start --vm-driver=none`  
- Edit `run_kubernetes.sh` with your docker image.
- Run `run_kubernetes.sh` this will create a pod.
- Make predictions again using `./make_prediction.sh`
